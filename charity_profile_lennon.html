<h1>Lennon Pregnancy Center</h1>
<h2>What We Do</h2>
<p>
    Taken from the Lennon Website: The Lennon Pregnancy Center offers non-judgmental counseling, material 
    assistance, and education before, during and after pregnancy. The Center feels an obligation to women who, 
    through our influence, chose to continue their pregnancy and provides its supportive services for up 
    to five years following the birth of the baby. The Center desires to break the cycle that often is passed 
    down from generation to generation and to assist women in becoming the best mothers they can be. 
</p>
<h2>Why You Should Volunteer</h2>
<p>
    If you are looking to volunteer and help mothers and families in need then this is the place for you! Here 
    you can make an impact and help these women and families in their pregnancy and beyond.
