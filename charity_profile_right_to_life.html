<h1>Right to Life Michigan</h1>

<h2>What We Do</h2>
<p>
    Taken from the Right to Life Michigan Website: Right to Life of Michigan (RLM), our 80+ affiliates, 
    and thousands of volunteers from all walks of life seek to build a society which welcomes and supports 
    life at all stages. RLM offers tools and resources, staff experts, and volunteers committed to helping 
    you build a practical path forward, bringing hope and happiness in making a choice for life.
    We are here to stand with you. No one in Michigan should feel they are alone when faced with a decision 
    for life: a personal decision, a consideration to help a friend, a hope to educate your school or community 
    or just a question to learn more. We aim to walk alongside you!
</p>

<h2>Why You Should Volunteer</h2>
<p>
    If you are passionate about being Pro-Life and want to help pregnant women and families in need, this is the place
    for you!
